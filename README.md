Yelp Dataset Analysis ReadMe

This project was a collaborative effort to enhance Tucson restaurant business strategies and improve customer retention by analyzing the Yelp dataset. The analysis was conducted using natural language processing (NLP) techniques to extract insights from unstructured data.

Dataset Overview

The Yelp dataset is a publically available dataset containing reviews, photos, check-ins, and attributes related to businesses. 

Methods Used

To analyze the dataset, we employed two main tools:

Sentiment Analysis: We used BERT sentiment analysis to analyze user reviews and extract insights from unstructured data.

Machine Learning Models: We developed and implemented machine learning models using TensorFlow/Keras to classify positive and negative restaurant reviews and identify key factors influencing restaurant success.

Tools Used

Amazon Web Services for running the Yelp dataset
BERT, NLTK for sentiment analysis for analyzing user reviews
Matplotlib for data visualization
TensorFlow/Keras for building machine learning models

Output
